Ryalto Initial thoughts

-	Not responsive – especially header, mobile should have collapsed nav
-	No obvious course of action – expand whitespace to make it easier on the eye and direct user towards the goal of the site
-	Blog should have its own page; home page can have a preview of 2-3 posts
-	Have a preview of the team members as well
-	Move socials to footer – don’t want to link elsewhere on the web after just arriving on the page

Afterthought 

- Branding and feeling of the page remained the same
- More modern design, e.g cards have more subtle shadow
